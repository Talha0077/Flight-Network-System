# Flight-Network-System
End semester project for the data structures and algorithms course.
Give the absolute path for the data file in the "flight network.h" header file if you are using Clion.
The focus was on learning and implementing as many data structures as possible.
Format of the dataset file is {source airport ID},{source airport IATA code}, {source airport name}, {destination ID}, {destination IATA}, {destination name}, {distance in km}
The distance is not the same as what you're going to find on google because it was calculated using latitude and longitude of the cities.
Dataset is great for doing graph problems. It was made using two different datasets included in the project folder and output file stream in C++
